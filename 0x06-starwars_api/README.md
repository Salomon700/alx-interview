# Star Wars Characters API

This project involves creating a Node.js script that interacts with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to retrieve information about Star Wars characters.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Axios (for making HTTP requests)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-interview.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd alx-interview/0x06-starwars_api
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:
```bash
node 0-starwars_characters.js <character_id>
```
Replace `<character_id>` with the ID of the character you want to retrieve information about.

## Example

```bash
node 0-starwars_characters.js 1
```

This command will fetch and display information about the character with ID 1.
